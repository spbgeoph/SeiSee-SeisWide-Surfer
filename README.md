# SeiSee-SeisWide-Surfer
Program which help build time fields based on seismic fields. Input is a data about travel-time picks obtained in SeisWide.
First entry can be interpolated, for reflected waves squared times and offsets are calculated.
Output can be then loaded into Surfer so one can quickly estimate if the SeisWide output and overall geophysical
data such as profile coordinates, offsets, etc is consistent.
